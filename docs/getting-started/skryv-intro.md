To realise this, the platform comes with different modules, for which you can find more information in the following sections.

For specific government levels, we offer premade integration kits, including the housestyle, connectors to common systems and data sources, ... The VO Kit is such a kit for the Flemish Government. [Contact us](https://www.skryv.com/contact) for more information or if you want (to develop) your own kit.

## Front-office
The Front-office lets citizens, professionals, organisations and companies easily use your digital service

*Filing the requests is just the start. The Front-Office comes with all the functionality your users to follow the requests from beginning to the end.*

* Unified user experience with your house style
* Secure log-in through proven and known mechanisms
* Only ask relevant information through smart forms
* Speed up the workflows by letting user participate in the workflow
* Inform you user with proactive communications
* Easy access to running & past requests
* Simplify your internal workflow by linking to your back-office

## Automation
Process automation allows you to saves time on repetitive tasks and provides a faster service at a lower cost

*From partial automation to fully automated rights assignment. Many of the transactional government services will benefit from process automation.*

* Unburden your team by removing repetitive manual tasks from theid plate
* Save time by automatically collecting data from various (authentic) sources
* Raise quality by automating business decisions
* Easily integrate the automated processes with your other applications through APIs or bulk
* Build future proof solutions based on clean architecture patterns and global standards (BPMN, DMN)
* Ensure correctness of the automation through an easy to use test interface
* Remain compliant with the proper security measures, even for sensitive personal data
  
## Back-office
The Back-office lets your teams work efficiently with the right info at the right time

*From partial automation to fully automated rights assignment. Many of the transactional government services will benefit from process automation.*

* Support place & time independent working with an intuitive web interface
* Guide your team by providing relevant context & easy to complete tasks

* Find the bottlenecks in your workflow through heatmaps
* Track progress through operational dashboards
* Support policy decisions through graphical visualisations
* Measure service performance
* Display Data on a Map
* Search through all data & create personal filters
* Integrate the data in your reporting environment (eg. QlikView)

## Connector Factory
The Connector Factory accelerates the connection to various services and ensures personal data protection

*Gartner indicates that a project cost is up to 50% for integrations. The connector factory provides an accelerator to connect  to your ecosystem of data & base services.*

* Lets you focus on the business aspects, as the connector factory solved the technical challenges already
* Reduces project effort through code generation, for REST & SOAP interfaces
* Supports reusable mini processes (eg. for payments)
* Ensures robustness through throttling, caching & circuit breaking
* Ensures compliance through end-to-end security including encryption & legal logging
* Enables secure testing with pseudonymised data
* Co-creation & Synergies possible through the Vastgoed.Kit

## VO Kit
The VO Kit supercharges the acceleration with building blocks in the Flemish Governments, replacing long integration tracks with maximal reuse

*Replace long integration tracks with maximal reuse*

* Single Government experience through the Flemish Government House style
* Create transparency to Flemish citizens with Mijn Burgerprofiel, eBox, DOSIS, ...
* Automate payments through the coupling with ORAFIN
* Provide Secure Login with eID, Itsme, ... with ACM-IDM
* Obtain Data Classification Level 4 compliance through the VO security building blocks (Landing Zone, PAM, Keystore, …)
* Support auto-completion of official data like addresses, car info, ...
* Realise the “only once” principle through out of the box connectors to Magda / KBV
* Answer business questions by combining business rules & data through Automatic Advice
